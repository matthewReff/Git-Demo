<h2><b>Linux:</b></h3>
<h3><u>Navigating Around</u></h3>
<pre>
% ls

This will display the files in your current directory
ls has many additonal flags, one of which is -a, <b>"ls -a"</b> will display all file in current directory, included hidden ones.
Another is <b>"ls -l"</b> which displays metadata information as well as the file names

% cd

This will move you to your home directory, this is the same location as "~".

% cd <b>{path}</b>

This will change your current directory to the given path.

% cat <b>{filename}</b>

This will display the contents of a file in the console window.

% mkdir <b>{path}</b>

This will make a new directory at the given path.

% pwd

This will print your current working directory, which is where you currently are.
</pre>
<h3><u>Special Paths</u></h3>
<pre>
% ..

".." is a special name for the parent of the current directory, so "cd .." will move you up one file.

% .

"." is a special name for your current directory, so you can endlessly "cd ." and move nowhere.

% ~

"~" is a special name for your home directory and is the implied argument in an empty cd
This is where the files you think of as yours will usually be located.
</pre>

<h3><u>Manipulating Files</u></h3>
<pre>
% cp <b>{sourceFileName}</b> <b>{destFileName}</b>

cp will copy a file from a source to a destination

% touch <b>{filename}</b>

touch will update the "most recently used" timestamp of a file, and create a blank file with that name if one doesn't already exist

<h2><b>Git:</b></h3>
<h3><u>Create Repository</u></h3>
<pre>
This will create a copy (or <i>clone</i>) of a repository on the school's
gitlab server.

% git clone git@gitlab.mcs.sdsmt.edu:<b>username</b>/project_name.git

Where <b>username</b> is the gitlab username or group on gitlab.mcs.sdsmt.edu
      <b>project_name.git</b> is the project name on gitlab.mcs.sdsmt.edu

EX: % git clone https://github.com/matthewReff/Git-Demo

% git clone <b>{URI}</b>.git

Where <b>{URI}</b> is the link for a non mcs repository.

% git init 

This will create a new local repository which is rooted in the current 
directory.  Keep in mind this repository is only local.
</pre>
<p>
<h3><u>Commands for local changes</u></h3>
<pre>
See the changed (added, deleted, moved, etc.) files in your working directory

% git status

See changes to the files that git is tracking

% git diff

Add all current untracked files / changes to the next commit.  This can be
problematic if you have files which should not be added to the repository.
This includes: binary files, object files, generated files, editor backup
files, etc.

% git add .

Add the changes in <i>filename</i> to the next commit

% git add <b>filename</b>

Commit all local changes in the tracked files

% git commit -a

Commit previously staged changes

% git commit

Make a change to the last commit.  Note: <b>Do not</b> amend commits which have
been <i>git push</i>ed to a remote repository.

% git commit --amend
</pre>
<h3><u>Commit History</u></h3>
<pre>
Show all commits, starting with the newest

% git log

Show changes over time for a specific <b>filename</b>

% git log -p <b>filename</b>

Indicate who changed what and when in <b>filename</b>

% git blame <b>filename</b>
</pre>
<h3><u>Update and Publish (push)</u></h3>
<pre>
List all currently configured remotes (we usually only use a single remote)

% git remote -v

Show information about a remote

% git remote show <b>remote name</b>

   Where <b>remote name</b> is the remote repository <i>git@gitlab.mcs.sdsmt.edu:username/projectname.git</i>

Download changes and merge/integrate them into <b>HEAD</b>

% git pull

Publish local changes on the remote

% git push
</pre>
<h3><u>Commands to undo or fix something</u></h3>
<pre>
Discard all local changes in your working directory

% git reset --hard HEAD

Discard local changes in a specific <b>file</b>

% git checkout <b>file</b>

or

% git checkout HEAD <b>file</b>

Revert a commit (this is done by producing a new commit with contrary changes)

% git revert <b>commit</b>

   Where <b>commit</b> is a previous commit hash

Reset your HEAD pointer to a previous <b>commit</b> (this discards all changes since that previous commit)

% git reset --hard <b>commit</b>
